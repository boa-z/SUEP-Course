Hello, everyone. My name is XXX and I am a student of integrated circuit design and integrated system. I am very happy to be here and share some information about myself with you.

I have always been interested in electronics and technology since I was a child. I like to explore how different devices work and how they can be improved. I also enjoy programming and creating my own applications. That's why I chose this major, because I want to learn more about the principles and methods of designing and integrating circuits and systems.

In my spare time, I like to read books, watch movies, play games, and listen to music. In order to play with friends, I purchased a server to build a Minecraft game server.

I am very glad to meet you all and I hope we can become good friends and help each other in our studies. I also look forward to learning from our teachers and improving my skills and abilities. Thank you for your attention.
